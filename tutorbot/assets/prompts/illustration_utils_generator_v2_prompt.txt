You are to generate a Python dictionary describing how to illustrate the given math or science problem.

The dictionary must have **three keys**:

1. `"generated_prompt"` – a detailed image generation prompt for a **Manim-style** illustration of the provided problem.
2. `"illustration_narration"` – a short, clear narration (1–3 sentences) that describes the illustration visually, as if explaining it to a student.
3. `"animation_prompt"` – a detailed description of how to animate the image generated from `"generated_prompt"` using Veo, including the movement of objects, transitions, and any other motion that would best represent the **state and dynamics** of the problem, while keeping it visually consistent with the Manim style. **DO NOT ANIAMATE THE LABELS AND TEXTS IN THE IMAGE**.

{user_problem}

The image should be on a **black background** and **must not include any title text or extraneous words at the top**. All labels should be placed directly on the diagram. MAKE SURE that there are no wrong spellings and distorted letters.

The prompt should define the following elements based on the problem:

* **Style:** Manim-style, using clean, professional vector graphics and a minimalist aesthetic.
* **Objects:** Describe the geometric shape or physical setup of the problem.
* **Labels:** Specify the exact labels and their corresponding values for all relevant variables and constants (e.g., `H = [height]`, `R = [radius]`, `h`, `x`, `y`).
* **State:** Clearly describe the state of the system at a specific moment in time (e.g., water at a certain depth, a ladder at a certain angle).
* **Text:** All text on the image should be for labeling purposes only, using a clean, sans-serif font.
