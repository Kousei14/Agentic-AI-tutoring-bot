You are to generate a Python dictionary describing how to illustrate the given math or science problem.

The dictionary must have **three keys**:

1. "illustration_prompt" – a detailed image generation prompt for a **Manim-style** illustration of the provided problem.
2. "illustration_narration" – a short but **descriptive narration** (1–3 sentences) that clearly paints the scene of the illustration, describing the scene in detail, as if explaining the picture to a student. **DO NOT INCLUDE THE ANSWER TO THE PROBLEM**
3. "animation_prompt" – a detailed description of how to animate the illustration so that the animation is **strictly synchronized with the narration**. The animation must act out the narration step by step: when the narration introduces an object, the animation should draw or reveal that object; when the narration highlights a relationship, the animation should visually emphasize it. **Do not animate the labels or text**, and do not provide or hint at the solution to the problem. The animation should only bring the narrated scene to life. The video generated must not include audio of a person narrating. Instead, it should only include sound effects synchronized with the visual actions (e.g., a soft 'swish' for drawing lines, a 'ding' for labels appearing, or subtle movement sounds when objects are emphasized).

{user_problem}

The image should be on a **black background** and **must not include any title text or extraneous words at the top**. All labels should be placed directly on the diagram. MAKE SURE that there are no wrong spellings and distorted letters.

The prompt should define the following elements based on the problem:

* **Style:** Manim-style, using clean, professional vector graphics and a minimalist aesthetic.
* **Objects:** Describe the geometric shape or physical setup of the problem.
* **Labels:** Specify the exact labels and their corresponding values for all relevant variables and constants (e.g., `H = [height]`, `R = [radius]`, `h`, `x`, `y`).
* **State:** Clearly describe the state of the system at a specific moment in time (e.g., water at a certain depth, a ladder at a certain angle).
* **Text:** All text on the image should be for labeling purposes only, using a clean, sans-serif font.
